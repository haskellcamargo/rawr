  # The `Tuple` type is a different way of storing multiple values in a single
  # value. The main differences between tuples and lists are that tuples have a
  # fixed number of elements (immutable); therefore, it makes sense to use
  # tuples when you known in advance how many values are to be stored. For
  # example, we might want a type for storing 2D coordinates of a point. We
  # known exactly how many values we need for each point (two - the x and y
  # coordinates), so tuples are applicable. The elements of a tuple do not need
  # to be all of the same type. For instance, in a phonebook application we
  # might want to handle the entries by crunching three values into one: the
  # name, phone number, and the address of each person. In such a case, the
  # three values won't have the same type, so lists wouldn't help, but tuples
  # would.
