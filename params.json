The project started after a big criticism to PHP and its inconsistence with function names and the design of the language. To solve a big part of these problems, we got Rawr. It implements and simulates static-typing (via contracts by wrappers), functional programming (piping, method-chaining, monads, typeclasses, algebraic-data-types, pattern-matching), a more pure object-orientation (with the concept of Self and Smalltalk OO, where everything is an object that can receive and pass messages) and the concept of modules, in a way similar as Python or Haskell do, aiming a more pure way to program and taking into account that so many developers do several mistakes and workarouns with PHP. Rawr is build to be type-safe and for applications that require to not crash.\r\n\r\n### Static typing\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
