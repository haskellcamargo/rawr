<p>Rawr is a word that means "I love you in dinosaur, but it also is this small library build to implement a lot of features to the PHP language.
Rawr is an open-source project meant to make the PHP language a few better, as much as it has a lot of little failures that sometimes let me angry. The project started after a big criticism to PHP and its inconsistence with function names and the design of the language. To solve a big part of these problems, we got Rawr. It implements and simulates static-typing (via contracts by wrappers), functional programming (piping, method-chaining, monads, typeclasses, algebraic-data-types, pattern-matching), a more pure object-orientation (with the concept of Self and Smalltalk OO, where everything is an object that can receive and pass messages) and the concept of modules, in a way similar as Python or Haskell do, aiming a more pure way to program and taking into account that so many developers do several mistakes and workarouns with PHP. Rawr is build to be type-safe and for applications that require to not crash.</p>
